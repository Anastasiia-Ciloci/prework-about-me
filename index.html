      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        After working in the beauty industry for few years, I've decided to
        switch careers. I got interested in computers because you can build and
        create cool things.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Russia, in the beautiful city of Vladivostok.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        I love art! I've been painting pictures using oils, acrylics and
        recently started practicing watercolors.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        It's one that I'm gonna like.ðŸ˜ƒ <br />
        But honestly, I would like to have a job where I can build a nice
        product that thousands of people use every day. And where I can grow,
        get experience and getting better and better at programming.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>For the last 6 years I have been living in Virginia Beach, VA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        Because now it is in high demand and also gives the opportunity to work
        remotely from anywhere in the world.
